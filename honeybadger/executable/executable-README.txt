HOW TO USE LAUNCH4J
==========================

1. Replace the JAR at bin/BadgerV6-Desktop with the artifact you want to use to build the EXE.
    2.b If you wish to change the file name of the JAR artifact, you must modif the Launch4JConfig.xml accordingly.
2. Open Launch4J and load the config file Launch4JConfig.xml.
3. Click the 'gear' icon at the top of the application to build the executable.
4. Once complete, the executable is ready for use.

!!IMPORTANT!!
To deploy the executable, you must move the Badger.exe AND the bin folder together. The executable will not function
without the bin folder in the same directory.
