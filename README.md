# The Honeybadger V6.0
*Repo for Concordia University's Engineering Games 2017 Machine (The Honeybadger V.VI)*

## Overview
This repository contains the source code of the honeybadger V6. The source which resides in the "honeybadger/Machine" folder is divided into three main modules, represented by the packages below:
* `Machine.desktop` is the Badger Command UI, intended to run on desktops computers to control the honeybadger itself
* `Machine.rpi` holds the actual code intended to run on (or emulate) the Raspberry Pi, which interfaces with the custom electronics stack. Many of the packages depend on a Pi4J installation to run correctly
* Finally, `Machine.common` contains any classes used by both platforms to interact with each other or provide miscellaneous services.

## Setup, building and running
This project was developped with Idea's Intellij IDE and requires Java 8 update 111.
The codebase can be managed easily by opening the main module "Forge" in Intellij.
To compile the classes, right click on the "Machine" folder and select the "Build Machine" option. This will generate all classes
in the "out" folder. Compilation and execution can also be done from command line with "javac" and "java" commands.

A self-contained, deployable release can also be generated by building a JAR file with Intellij, and is part of full module 
build steps.
